Remembering how markdown works...

# Headers!
## Smaller Headers
### Lol yet smaller headers

# Code blocks!
```
bind-utils
git
ping
rsync
tmux
vim (if you skip vim you get vim-minimal as part of Base)
```

# Formatting

## Italics or Bold? Use asterisks (or underscores):

*One for italics...*
**Or two for **bold!**
Want both? Use three for the *really,* **really,** ***IMPORTANT*** stuff.
But _underscores_ will __also__ work.

## Lists

Ordered lists?
1. here's the first
5. and the second
3. then three (number don't matter)

Unordered Lists!
- nicely
- done
- friend!

# And that's it!
Except for the other stuff of course...
